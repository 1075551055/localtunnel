I can expose it to the world just by running\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ lt --port 8000\r\nyour url is: http://gqgh.localtunnel.me\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can now share http://gqgh.localtunnel.me with anyone. As long as your local instance of `lt` is running, this url will remain active. Any requests to that url will be routed to your service on port 8000.\r\n\r\n### uses\r\n\r\nBeyond sharing with friends, localtunnel makes a great tool for testing with any service which needs to hit internet visible URLs.\r\n\r\n* browserling.com\r\n* twillio testing\r\n* sendgrid web api","name":"localtunnel","tagline":"expose yourself to the world","google":""}
